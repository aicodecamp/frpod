You would like to create a website,
but you don't really know how

00:03.750 --> 00:05.760
how to go about it or where to start?

00:06.750 --> 00:10.230
Maybe some of you could
call on a freelance developer,

00:10.890 --> 00:15.030
but you say to yourself: "No, all the same,
I’d love to do it myself.”

00:16.470 --> 00:21.680
The best way to dive into the world
of the web is to start with the basics: learn

00:21.780 --> 00:25.470
to write in HTML language and CSS language.

00:26.370 --> 00:28.830
This is often where we start
when you learn to code,

00:29.220 --> 00:33.480
because all the sites, I mean all the sites,
on which we browse on the Internet,

00:33.630 --> 00:35.460
are created in these two languages.

00:36.240 --> 00:40.250
If you've always wanted to create
your first web pages, then you are

00:40.350 --> 00:41.250
at a good place.

00:42.180 --> 00:46.620
In this course, you will quickly be
able to master the basics of HTML5,

00:47.130 --> 00:52.400
to do formatting with CSS3,
to arrange the content of your pages or to create

00:52.500 --> 00:53.550
your own forms.

00:54.570 --> 00:58.710
So, ready to create a website from A to Z?
