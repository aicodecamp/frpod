00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What do you usually do on weekends?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
On the weekend, on Saturday, I have my guitar lesson.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Afterwards, I often go to the cinema with friends.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Do you play classical guitar?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
No, I play folk guitar.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And on Sunday, what do you do?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
On Sundays, I sleep in.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And then I do the cleaning.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But if the weather is nice, I prefer to go to the mountains or the sea.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And you, what do you generally do on weekends?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I work on Saturdays.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But on Saturday evenings, I often go out with my colleagues after work.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And on Sunday, you don't work?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Fortunately not.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So on Sunday morning, I sleep in too.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And in the afternoon, I see friends or go shopping.
